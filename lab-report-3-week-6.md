* After copying the code from the lab report, I opened the `.ssh/config` file using vim. Then, I copied and pasted the code in the file after the existing entry. After saving this file, I can now log into my account by simply entering `ssh ieng6`.

* This is so much easier and it saves me a lot of time. Before I had to go back to the lab report instructions many times because I always had typos when entering in my ieng6 address.

* Again, this saves me a lot of time since I don't have to type in my entire ieng6 address, which I often entered incorrectly.
